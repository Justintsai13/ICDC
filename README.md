# IC Design Contest

## 2018 Image Display Control

Design an image display control circuit (LCD_CTRL) that performs operations on 2x2 regions including movement (up/down/left/right), statistical operations (MAX/MIN/AVG), rotation (clockwise/counterclockwise), and mirroring (X/Y axis). The circuit reads 8x8 grayscale images from IROM, and after processing, writes the results to IRAM and asserts the done signal.
